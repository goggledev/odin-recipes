        <p>A quick easy recipe for this newyork styleed treat.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>3 tablespoons melted butter</li>
            <li>18 graham crackers, crushed</li>
            <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>4 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
            <li>⅔ cup milk</li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Lightly grease the bottom and sides of a 9-inch springform pan.</li>
            <li>Mix graham cracker crumbs and melted butter in a bowl until evenly moistened. Press crumb mixture into the bottom and about 1/2-inch up the sides of the springform pan.</li>
            <li>Whisk flour, sour cream, and vanilla extract in bowl. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Stir cream cheese and sugar with a wooden spoon in a large bowl until evenly incorporated, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Pour milk into cream cheese mixture and whisk until just combined.</li>
            <li>Whisk in eggs, one at a time, stirring well after each addition.</li>
            <li>Stir in lemon zest, orange zest, and sour cream mixture; whisk until just incorporated.</li>
            <li>Pour mixture into prepared springform pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges have nicely puffed and the surface of the cheesecake is firm except for a small spot in the center that will jiggle when the pan is gently shaken, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>When the cheesecake is done, turn off the oven and let it cool in the oven for 3 to 4 hours. This prevents any cracks from forming on the top of the cheesecake.</li>
        </ol>
